      <p>After gaming for a long period of time, what feels tired? Eyes, hands, mind, wrists, neck, etc. What can you do differently to alleviate pain or tiredness when gaming? In order to prevent alleviate pain or tiredness you should move around and get your blood flow going and start eating to keep you're mind going throughout the process. You should not only consume healthy food while playing but take breaks throughout and eat as you break.                                                                             &nbsp; </p>
